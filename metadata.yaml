description: Imagination relates either to the past, the present or the future. On
  the one hand, it is the outright re-imagery in the mind's eye of past experiences.
  On the other hand, it is the creation of new and original mental images or visions
  by the recombination of old experiential elements. Do not understand us as saying
  that imagination, as the term is popularly used, is all you need. There must be
  also action, incessant, persistent. But creative imagination, in a psychological
  and scientific sense, begets action. Every thought carries with it the impellent
  energy to effect its realization. Use yo.
